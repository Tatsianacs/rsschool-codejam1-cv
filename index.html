        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I have been working in IT as a Software Test Engineer for more than 8 years but interested in learning new
          things and technologies. I have technical background and analytical skills, fluent English and
          experience in working in different projects. I am eager to learn and will do my best to achieve the goal. I
          like Steve Jobs's quote and it describes my decision the
          best way:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/903982-you-ve-got-to-find-what-you-love-and-that-is">
          Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what
          you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it
          yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
        </blockquote>
        <p>One more thing is that I am working on the project where motto is <span>"One for all and all for one"</span>,
          i.e. if
          needed, a programmer executes manual test cases and after that they ask testers to fix the bugs. I find it
          challenging :)
